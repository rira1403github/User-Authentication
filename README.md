# User Authentication

This repository provides a full-stack solution for user authentication, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project includes both client and server components to handle user registration, login, and session management.

## Project Structure

- **`client/`**: Contains the React.js front-end application for user authentication.
- **`server/`**: Includes the Node.js and Express.js backend API for managing authentication.
- **`node_modules/`**: Dependencies for both client and server (auto-generated).
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that locks dependencies to specific versions.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create an account with email and password.
- **User Login**: Enables users to log in and access protected resources.
- **Session Management**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions and authentication.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt.
